# javascript-algoriths-challenge
Two quick JS challenges: 

1) A string reducer method that receives a string comprised of the letters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Any time we have two of these letters located next to each other (e.g. 'ab') we need to replace it with the third letter that's not included in that combination (i.e. 'c' in this example);
 
2) A wildcard comparison method. A string composed of a left and right portion, divided by whitespace, is passed. The job of the method is to verify that the right side (actual string) matches the pattern encoded in the left side
